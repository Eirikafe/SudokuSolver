# SudokuSolver

Project that introduced me to both Python as well as the Pygame library

Uses a depth first search algorithm called backtracking to see if a number is valid in the current square. If it is valid, it moves on to the next square.
If it is not valid, it goes back to previous squares to test new combinations of numbers. It is a brute force algorithm, but given the nature of Sudoku,
it is a pretty valid solution.
